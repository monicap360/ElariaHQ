# CVB Content Governance

## Pillar 1: Own the role of “official-feeling” source
- CVB tone, neutral and calm language
- Informational priority
- Service-first positioning

## Pillar 2: Time-based authority (impossible to fake)
- Anchor content in years of real experience
- Emphasize consistency, accuracy, hospitality over time

## Pillar 3: Location-locked expertise
- Focus on cruises from Galveston only
- Include local operational realities: terminals, parking, traffic, hotels, onboarding flow

## Pillar 4: Hospitality language over marketing language
- Use: welcome, care, service, guidance, respect, calm authority
- Avoid: hype, pressure, gimmicks

## Pillar 5: Content governance (non-negotiable rules)
- No hype
- No pressure
- No gimmicks
- No trend chasing
- No “growth hacking” copy
- Test: “Would this feel appropriate if read aloud at a hotel front desk?”

## Pillar 6: Authorship & attribution (EEAT lock)
- By Monica Peña
- Written from lived experience
- Consistent attribution and tone

## Pillar 7: Community as a service, not a feature
- Sea You On Deck is hospitality continuation, not a forum
- Focus on reassurance and shared experience

## Pillar 8: Legal + brand defensibility
- Declare original authorship
- Anchor usage dates
- Use distinctive phrasing
- Frame content as experiential, not generic

## Pillar 9: Design that ages gracefully
- Calm, timeless, trustworthy
- Avoid trends and flashy UI
