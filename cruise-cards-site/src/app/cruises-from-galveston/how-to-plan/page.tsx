        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Is Galveston the right port?</h2>
        <p className="text-slate-600">
          Galveston is the most accessible cruise port for many travelers in Texas and nearby states. It is a strong
          choice if you prefer shorter travel distances, flexible sailing lengths, and a simpler embarkation day.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Driving vs flying</h2>
        <p className="text-slate-600">
          Driving offers flexibility for luggage and family gear. Flying works best for long-distance travelers, with
          ground transfer from Houston airports to Galveston. Build a buffer day if you are flying in.

        <p className="text-slate-600">

        <p className="text-slate-600">

          close and use a single organizer for payments and confirmations.
