          Welcome to Galveston — and welcome to the place where your cruise journey truly begins.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-slate-600">
          If you’re reading this, you’re either preparing to sail, already booked, or simply looking for clear, honest
          answers. No matter where you booked your cruise, you are welcome here.

        <p className="mt-3 text-slate-600">
          Cruises From Galveston was built with one purpose: to make sure every traveler arriving to our island feels
          informed, prepared, and genuinely cared for.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">This is more than a cruise website</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          This site is not just about ships, sailings, or deals. It’s about knowing where to park without stress,
          understanding what embarkation day actually feels like, helping first-time cruisers avoid common mistakes,
          supporting guests who already booked but still have questions, and welcoming travelers the way a host
          welcomes guests into their home.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Galveston is not just a port — it’s a working island, a hospitality town, and a place where timing, traffic,
          weather, and logistics matter. That’s why everything here is written from real, on-the-ground experience, not
          generic cruise copy.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Why you can trust this information</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          My name is Monica Peña, and I’ve spent my career in hospitality, transportation, and travel operations — not
          just behind a desk, but face-to-face with guests. I’ve managed hotels and served both overnight and
          extended-stay travelers, worked directly with cruise guests arriving early, late, tired, excited, or unsure,
          driven cruise shuttle routes and transported guests to and from terminals, welcomed travelers at check-in
          desks, meet-and-greets, and arrival points, and helped guests navigate luggage rules, parking, embarkation
          timing, and port days.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Cruising from Galveston is not theoretical to me — it’s operational.

      <section className="mt-10 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Already booked? You’re still at home here</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          You do not have to book with us to be supported here. Many travelers arrive with questions like: Do I really
          need a passport? Is the drink package worth it? How much luggage can I bring? What can I do in port if I don’t
          book an excursion? What should I wear on embarkation day? Where should I park if I’m driving in? What if I’m
          coming from out of town on I-10?
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          This site exists to answer those questions honestly and clearly, even if your booking was made elsewhere.
          That’s hospitality.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">A Galveston-first, visitor-focused approach</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Everything you see on CruisesFromGalveston.net is written with a Visitor & Convention Bureau mindset, a hotel
          and transportation operations perspective, a first-time cruiser’s questions in mind, and respect for
          travelers who may feel overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          You’ll notice we focus heavily on location and arrival flow, parking and park-and-ride options, embarkation
          day expectations, port-specific guidance, and what actually happens before and after your cruise — because
          that’s what guests really need.

          Galveston welcomes travelers from all over Texas and beyond — families, couples, solo cruisers, and
          first-timers who just want reassurance that they’re doing things right.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          My promise to you is simple: this site will always remain accurate, experience-based, visitor-focused, and
          rooted in real Galveston operations. Whether this is your first cruise or your fifteenth, you belong here. We
          can’t wait to welcome you to Galveston — and we look forward to seeing you again.
