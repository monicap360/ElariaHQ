        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Why I created Cruises From Galveston</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Cruises From Galveston was built out of real, hands-on experience, not marketing. Before launching this
          platform, I spent years working directly in Galveston hospitality and guest operations — welcoming travelers,
          answering questions face-to-face, helping guests navigate arrival days, hotels, transportation, terminals,
          and the small details that make a big difference.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">I&apos;ve worked:</p>
        <ul className="mt-2 grid gap-2 text-sm text-slate-600 sm:grid-cols-2">
          <li>In hotel operations on Galveston Island</li>
          <li>With guests arriving before and after cruises</li>
          <li>In shuttle and transportation environments</li>
          <li>During embarkation-day chaos and calm alike</li>
          <li>Helping travelers who were excited, nervous, or simply unsure</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          What I learned quickly was this: most cruise stress doesn&apos;t come from the cruise — it comes from not knowing
          what to expect before you ever board.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mt-10 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">The gap no one was filling</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          There were plenty of sites selling cruises. Very few were helping guests understand Galveston itself. Guests
          were asking questions every day — often at the last minute — and not always getting clear answers.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">Questions like:</p>
        <ul className="mt-2 grid gap-2 text-sm text-slate-600 sm:grid-cols-2">
          <li>Where should I park?</li>
          <li>When should I arrive?</li>
          <li>What terminal am I using?</li>
          <li>Do I need a passport?</li>
          <li>What should I wear?</li>
          <li>What if I already booked but still feel lost?</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          So I created Cruises From Galveston to be the place where first-time cruisers feel welcomed, returning guests
          feel supported, and travelers feel informed — not rushed or pressured.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">A hospitality-first approach</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          This site is built with a hospitality heart. That means we don&apos;t rush you, we don&apos;t talk down to you, and we
          don&apos;t disappear once you book. Whether you booked through us, another agent, or directly with the cruise
          line — you are welcome here.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Think of this site as a visitor center, a front desk, a calm voice saying, “You&apos;re doing just fine.”

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Why Galveston matters to me</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Galveston isn&apos;t just a departure port — it&apos;s a community. Every sailing day, travelers arrive from Texas,
          Louisiana, across the country, and around the world. For many, Galveston is the first impression of their
          cruise.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          I believe that impression should feel organized, welcoming, respectful, and grounded in real local knowledge.
          That belief is at the core of everything you&apos;ll find on this site.

          The Real Cruises From Galveston Experience™ means information based on real operations, not assumptions;

          last.

        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">Real hospitality experience behind Cruises From Galveston.</p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Cruises From Galveston is guided by real hospitality and operations experience, not just online bookings.
          Monica Peña is a Certified Director of Marketing &amp; Sales with IHG, with hands-on experience serving both
          transient and extended-stay travelers — the same types of guests who cruise from Galveston every week.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Her background includes managing and marketing hotel properties in Abilene, Texas:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-2 grid gap-2 text-sm text-slate-600 sm:grid-cols-2">
          <li>La Quinta Inn &amp; Suites Abilene — 3018 Catclaw Drive, Abilene, Texas</li>
          <li>Candlewood Suites Abilene — 3050 Catclaw Drive, Abilene, Texas</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">Through these roles, Monica worked directly with:</p>
        <ul className="mt-2 grid gap-2 text-sm text-slate-600 sm:grid-cols-2">
          <li>First-time travelers</li>
          <li>Families planning milestone trips</li>
          <li>Long-stay guests with complex logistics</li>
          <li>Guests arriving tired, anxious, or unsure — and needing clarity and reassurance</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          This experience shaped her understanding of arrival and departure stress, parking and transportation
          confusion, luggage, timing and documentation concerns, and the difference between selling travel and
          supporting travelers.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Why this matters for cruisers</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Cruise guests are not just customers — they are travelers in motion. Monica&apos;s hospitality background means
          this site is built with a visitor &amp; convention bureau mindset, a hotel operations understanding, and a
          real-world flow of arrival, stay, and departure — plus a service-first approach, even for guests who have
          already booked elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Whether you&apos;re cruising for the first time, driving in from out of town, staying overnight before sailing,
          or simply needing reassurance, this platform exists to serve, not just sell.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">A personal note to first-time cruisers</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          If this is your first cruise, I want you to know something: you don&apos;t need to know everything. You don&apos;t
          need to be perfect. And you don&apos;t need to have it all figured out right now.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Cruising is meant to be enjoyable — and preparation should feel empowering, not stressful. If this site helps
          you feel calmer, more confident, or more excited about your trip, then it&apos;s doing exactly what it was built
          to do.
