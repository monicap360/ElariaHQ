        <p className="mt-4 text-slate-600">
          If this is your first cruise, you’re probably excited — and quietly wondering if you’re missing something
          important. That’s normal.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-slate-600">
          Cruising has its own rhythm, language, and expectations. Most frustration first-time cruisers experience
          isn’t because cruising is hard — it’s because nobody explained the basics clearly.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">You don’t need to “know cruise stuff” to belong</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          One of the biggest myths is that cruises are only for “experienced travelers.” In reality, every sailing
          includes hundreds of first-time cruisers, cruise staff expect questions, and no one can tell it’s your first
          cruise unless you say so.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Galveston, in particular, welcomes many first-time cruisers because it’s a drive-to port. That means families,
          couples, and guests who’ve never cruised before feel comfortable starting here. You belong on this ship.
        </p>

      <section className="mt-10 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">You won’t miss the ship (if you follow one rule)</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          First-time cruisers often worry: “What if I miss the ship?” Here’s the rule that matters: if you are on a
          cruise-line-approved tour, the ship will wait. If you explore on your own, you must return before the posted
          all-aboard time.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">Ships don’t leave early. They leave on time. Set an alarm and you’ll be fine.</p>

      <section className="mt-10 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Shore excursions are optional — not mandatory</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          You do not have to book a shore excursion to enjoy a port. Many guests walk the port area, visit beaches
          independently, shop, eat locally, or relax onboard while others are ashore.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          If you didn’t book excursions in advance, you haven’t “missed out.” You’ve simply left yourself flexible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mt-10 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Drink packages: worth it or not?</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          A drink package may make sense if you drink several cocktails, specialty coffees, or sodas daily, don’t want
          to think about pricing onboard, and value convenience over budgeting.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          It may not be worth it if you drink occasionally, prefer water, tea, or included beverages, or you’ll be
          ashore most days. There is no “right” answer — just what fits your habits.
        </p>

      <section className="mt-10 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">You can bring shampoo, snacks, and comfort items</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Another first-time concern: “Can I bring my own things?” Yes. You can bring shampoo, conditioner, toiletries,
          over-the-counter medications, and limited snacks (depending on the cruise line).
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Cabins include basics, but they’re hotel-style — not personalized. Bring what makes you comfortable.
        </p>

      <section className="mt-10 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Luggage limits are generous (within reason)</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Cruise lines don’t weigh bags like airlines. The real limits are that you must carry your own luggage through
          embarkation and storage space in cabins is finite.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">Two checked bags per person is typical and realistic. Pack smart, not heavy.</p>

      <section className="mt-10 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">You don’t have to dress up (unless you want to)</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Cruises today are relaxed. Yes, some ships have elegant nights and optional dress-up evenings, but you won’t
          be judged if you skip them. Many guests dress casually every night. Comfort is always acceptable.
        </p>

      <section className="mt-10 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">The ship is your floating hotel — use it</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          First-time cruisers sometimes feel pressure to “do everything.” You don’t need to. You can stay onboard on
          port days, skip activities, and repeat what you love. Cruising isn’t about checking boxes — it’s about
          settling into a pace that feels good.

        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Many guests arrive with questions their booking source can’t answer: parking, arrival timing, what Galveston
          is really like, and what happens on embarkation day. This site exists to support cruisers, not just bookings.

        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Cruising should feel exciting — not intimidating. Galveston is one of the most welcoming cruise ports in the
          country, and first-time cruisers thrive here because it&apos;s grounded, accessible, and built around real
          hospitality.
